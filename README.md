# Win11TeamsFix
This script fixes login in errors on teams that connect to a network that doesnt support win 11<br />
Edit the script and add your user to the file path were it says as this script removes the teams files in app data<br />
Make sure to have teams closed or it will error.<br />
After running teams will ask you to re-login.<br />
